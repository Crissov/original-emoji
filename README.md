Note that starting in April 2012, [E-Mobile] and [KDDI au] basically adopted [NTT Docomo's i-mode][NTT Docomo] emoji design,
while [SoftBank] kept their own design which was already relatively close to [NTT Docomo].

[Sharp] (and Canon) electronic typewriters had monochrome emojis in private-use (Shift) JIS positions. 
These got reused for [J-Phone]'s and thus later Vodafone's and [Softbank]'s original emojis that competed with [NTT Docomo]'s.

Until circa mid-2015, Japanese carriers added emojis in their traditional design to Android phones, just like [Samsung](http://emojipedia.org/samsung/) still does and [LG](http://emojipedia.org/lg/) and [HTC](http://emojipedia.org/htc/) used to do.

[Disney Mobile] was a brand of [Softbank]. 
Its emoji set only changes some glyphs.

[Y! Mobile], the Yahoo-based brand under the [SoftBank] umbrella, fuses the prior [Willcom] and [E-Mobile] services. 
Willcom was a PTT (or PHS) provider, a non-cellular mobile phone technology almost only used in Japan.

[KDDI][KDDI au] uses _au_ as a brand name. 
It previously used labels like _[EZweb]_ and TUKA. 
They got their graphics mostly from [Openwave] who provided the mobile [WAP] browser.

[E-Mobile] had a service known as [eAccess].

[Astel] was another local PHS provider with early, monochrome emoji support.

Also see [this Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X-jx6rYCqEjkp3Z4_qhBW0etIVbk4gqslaWWbYvNROY/edit) for codes etc.

The original Unicode mapping tables etc. were hosted at [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/emoji4unicode), 
but were moved to [Github](https://github.com/googlei18n/emoji4unicode) (E4U) when Google Code was closed down. 
The documentation is still found at a [Google Site](http://sites.google.com/site/unicodesymbols/Home/emoji-symbols). 
Official [Unicode documentation](http://unicode.org/emoji/) now has 
[full chart](http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html) (huge document) and a [table of emoji origins](http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-versions-sources.html) of particular interest for this project. 
The [latest raw data](http://www.unicode.org/Public/emoji/latest/) also includes a [machine-readable file](http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/EmojiSources.txt) 
that is basically the condensed result of the E4U work.

[Viber]: viber/

Even less so than early 2000s competing Japanese telecommunication providers, 
many vendors of instant messengers and chat apps do still not seem interested in adopting Unicode as the sole method to interchange emojis. 
They keep custom sets, some of which can easily subsumed under the Unicode repertoire, others cannot. 
Some of these software products are already obsolete. 
The Unicode Consortium may consider these existing emojis, 
but often they ignore or alter this prior art when standardizing new emojis, 
because it is not a matter of interoperability.
Some of these allowed _theme packs_ or _skins_ to alter the looks of their emojis.

This includes [AIM] and [ICQ], [Skype] and [Windows/Microsoft (Live) Messenger][Live], [GTalk], [Viber], [WeChat] and [QQ], [Yahoo! Messenger][Yahoo], [Blackberry Messenger (BBM)][BBM] and [Cisco], FOSS [Trillian] and [Pidgin], but also forum and blog software like [phpBB] and [Wordpress].
Furthermore, some online games (often MMORPG) feature custom emoji sets for in-game communication, e.g. [Furcadia].
