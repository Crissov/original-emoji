# Original Japanese emoji resources #

Note that starting in April 2012, [E-Mobile](emobile/) and [KDDI au](kddi-au/)basically adopted [NTT Docomo's i-mode](ntt-docomo/) emoji design while [SoftBank](softbank/) kept their own design which was already relatively close to [NTT Docomo](ntt-docomo/).

[Sharp](sharp/) electronic typewriters had monochrome emojis in private-use (Shift) JIS positions. These got reused for [J-Phone's](j-phone/) and thus [Softbank's](softbank/) original emojis that competed with [NTT Docomo's](ntt-docomo/).

Until circa mid-2015, Japanese carriers added emojis in their traditional design to Android phones, just like Samsung still does and LG and HTC used to do.

[Disney Mobile](disney-mobile/) is a brand of [Softbank](softbank/). Its emoji set only changes some glyphs.

[Y! Mobile](y-mobile/), the Yahoo-based brand under the [SoftBank](softbank/) umbrella, fuses the prior [Willcom](willcom/) and [E-Mobile](emobile/) services. Willcom was a PTT provider, a non-cellular mobile phone technology almost only used in Japan.

[KDDI](kddi-au/) uses _au_ as a brand name. It previously used labels like [_EZweb_](ez-web/).

[E-Mobile](emobile/) had a service known as [eAccess](e-access/).

Also see [this Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X-jx6rYCqEjkp3Z4_qhBW0etIVbk4gqslaWWbYvNROY/edit) for codes etc.

The original Unicode mapping tables etc. were hosted at [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/emoji4unicode), 
but were moved to [Github](https://github.com/googlei18n/emoji4unicode) (E4U) when Google Code was closed down. 
The documentation is still found at a [Google Site](http://sites.google.com/site/unicodesymbols/Home/emoji-symbols). 
Official [Unicode documentation](http://unicode.org/emoji/) now has 
[full chart](http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html) (huge document) and a [table of emoji origins](http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-versions-sources.html) of particular interest for this project. 
The [latest raw data](http://www.unicode.org/Public/emoji/latest/) also includes a [machine-readable file](http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/EmojiSources.txt) 
that is basically the condensed result of the E4U work.
