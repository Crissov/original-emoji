# Original Japanese emoji resources #

[KDDI au]: kddi-au/
[NTT Docomo]: ntt-docomo/
[Sharp]: sharp/
[J-Phone's]: j-phone/
[SoftBank]: softbank/
[Disney Mobile]: disney-mobile/
[Y! Mobile]: y-mobile/
[Willcom]: willcom/
[E-Mobile]: emobile/
[eAccess](e-access/)

Note that starting in April 2012, [E-Mobile] and [KDDI au] basically adopted [NTT Docomo's i-mode][NTT Docomo] emoji design,
while [SoftBank] kept their own design which was already relatively close to [NTT Docomo].

[Sharp] (and Canon) electronic typewriters had monochrome emojis in private-use (Shift) JIS positions. 
These got reused for [J-Phone]'s and thus later Vodafone's and [Softbank]'s original emojis that competed with [NTT Docomo]'s.

Until circa mid-2015, Japanese carriers added emojis in their traditional design to Android phones, just like [Samsung](http://emojipedia.org/samsung/) still does and [LG](http://emojipedia.org/lg/) and [HTC](http://emojipedia.org/htc/) used to do.

[Disney Mobile] was a brand of [Softbank]. 
Its emoji set only changes some glyphs.

[Y! Mobile], the Yahoo-based brand under the [SoftBank] umbrella, fuses the prior [Willcom] and [E-Mobile] services. 
Willcom was a PTT (or PHS) provider, a non-cellular mobile phone technology almost only used in Japan.

[KDDI][KDDI au] uses _au_ as a brand name. 
It previously used labels like [_EZweb_](ez-web/) and TUKA.

[E-Mobile] had a service known as [eAccess].

The original Unicode mapping tables etc. were hosted at [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/emoji4unicode), 
but were moved to [Github](https://github.com/googlei18n/emoji4unicode) (E4U) when Google Code was closed down. 
The documentation is still found at a [Google Site](http://sites.google.com/site/unicodesymbols/Home/emoji-symbols). 
Official [Unicode documentation](http://unicode.org/emoji/) now has 
[full chart](http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html) (huge document) and a [table of emoji origins](http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-versions-sources.html) of particular interest for this project. 
The [latest raw data](http://www.unicode.org/Public/emoji/latest/) also includes a [machine-readable file](http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/EmojiSources.txt) 
that is basically the condensed result of the E4U work.
